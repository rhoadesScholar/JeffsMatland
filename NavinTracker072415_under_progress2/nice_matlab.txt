HOW TO RUN MATLAB WITH ALTERNATE PROCESS PRIORITIES IN WINDOWS:

(1) Copy an extra shortcut for starting Matlab onto your Windows desktop.
You can usually do this by dragging an existing shortcut onto the desktop
and holding the ALT button while unclicking.

(2) Rename the extra shortcut "Matlab low" or "Matlab high" or whatever
process priority you intend to use. (Once you're done, every time you
start Matlab by clicking this shortcut, the process will start with the
process priority you set below.)

(3) Right-click on this new shortcut and select "Properties" from the
menu.

(4) Change the entry in the "Target" field to the following, according
to your process priority preference. The executable file locations are
defaults and will work for most users; HOWEVER, you may have to adjust
them if your system keeps the files in different locations. If so, simply
do a search from the Windows "Start" button to find the files on your
computer named "cmd.exe" and "MATLAB.exe" and replace the paths below
with the paths that you obtain.

For LOW process priority, copy this into the "Target" field:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c start /low C:\MATLAB704\bin\win32\MATLAB.exe

For BELOW NORMAL process priority:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c start /belownormal C:\MATLAB704\bin\win32\MATLAB.exe

For NORMAL process priority:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c start /normal C:\MATLAB704\bin\win32\MATLAB.exe

For ABOVE NORMAL process priority:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c start /abovenormal C:\MATLAB704\bin\win32\MATLAB.exe

For HIGH process priority:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c start /high C:\MATLAB704\bin\win32\MATLAB.exe

For REALTIME process priority:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c start /realtime C:\MATLAB704\bin\win32\MATLAB.exe

(5) Click "Apply" and close the window.

(6) Use the new shortcut as usual. Congratulations.

(7) Keep in mind, at "low" priority, Matlab will only calculate when
nothing else is running, and at "realtime" or even "high" priority,
Matlab may hang your system until it is finished its calculations.
