for aligning fluor stacks 
    cherry standard - ttx3 (AIY), srh-142 (ADF), tdc1 (RIM, RIC), glr3 (RIA), str3 (ASI), odr7 (AWA), dat1 (CEP, ADE), flp17 (BAG) :his44:mCherry
    focus on pharynx lumen. 25 slices? 50 slices?
    get 3D matrix of mCherry channel for standard and test
    adjust test to maximize correlation between standard and test   imresize  imrotate imregister rigid3D
    Do imregister w/ test candidate center slice w/ target center slice
        get goodness of fit over all slices
        repeat w/ next test canidate center slice (+/- 2 or 3 slices)
        degrees of freedom: X-translation, Y-translation, Z-translation, 
        initial X-Y guess - manually draw line from nose tip to grinder, and also isthmus boundries perpendicular to AP axis
            rotate and scale target to fix (analytic solution?)
            translate to intersection, rotate/scale - analytic
        w/ optimizer, fine-tune to align centers of mass of fluor cells - detect by threshold (histogram-based), bwconncomp, regionprops Centroid
        then, the actual volumes
For standard, manually assign each nucleus X-Y-Z a name based on h20:GFP/normarski
        stack image, click get x-y, input name
        find GFP blobs, assign code number
        once labelled , assign all pixels of that blob that name; click on pixel, get name
        slider for z-stack
